1
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,659
Well,   it's   preventing   Greece   from   stabilizing   through   monetary   policy.

2
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,379
surprise,   in   2009   it's   revealed   that   the   government   has

3
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:06,640
been   cooking   the   books,   and   its   budget   deficit   is

4
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,280
not   6.7%,   but   double   that.   (clears throat)   Whoops.

5
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,680
money.   The   Troika,   a   group   consisting   of   two   EU

6
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,269
entities   and   the   International   Monetary   Fund,   has   come   to

7
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:41,539
bail   Greece   out-   Yay.   ...   in   a   bid   to

8
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,780
save   the   EU   from   the   ramifications   of   a   Greek

9
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,139
default.   Here's   the   plan:   lend   Greece   110   billion   Euros

10
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,719
to   avoid   default-   Phew.   ...   use   the   bailout   money

11
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,539
to   pay   off   expensive   creditors,   get   the   government   to

12
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,419
commit   to   higher   taxes   and   lower   spending   to   bring

13
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:54,319
the   country   back   into   a   surplus,   and   wait   for

14
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,509
this   recession   to   blow   over.   So,   on   May   2nd,

15
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,520
2010   the   Troika   tosses   Greece   a   lifeline   and...

16
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,860
Damn.   The   bailout   doesn't   quite   fix   the   problem.

17
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,060
In   fact,   the   austerity   measures   have   put   further   pressure

18
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,060
[...1 minute later...]

19
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,990
to   secure   any   further   debt   relief,   Greece   defaults,   missing

20
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,589
a   1.6   billion   Euro   debt   payment   to   the   IMF,

21
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:37,129
the   first   developed   country   to   ever   do   so.

22
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,980
the   government   shuts   down   its   stock   exchange   and   banking

23
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,220
system.   Greeks   continue   to   fight   against   a   new   bailout

24
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:49,110
the   country   in   financial   purgatory,   Grexit   inching   closer,   and

25
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,000
no   more   leverage   for   negotiation,   on   July   16th,   a

26
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,839
very   desperate   government   throws   in   the   towel,   grabbing   ahold

27
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,519
of   the   EU's   third   lifeline   and   accepting   an   86

28
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,339
billion   Euro   bailout   in   August.   And   so,   with   the

29
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,720
fight   to   boost   spending   meeting   a   dramatic   end,   the

30
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,399
cuts,   reforms,   and   hard   times   ahead.   All   in,   the

31
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,500
economy   will   shrink   25%   as   a   result   of   the

32
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,829
crisis.   And   while   Greece   has   since   finished   its   bailout

33
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,000
program,   the   country   to   this   day   maintains   a   debt

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
to   GDP   of   181%.   And   Greek   people   continue   to

35
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,300
suffer,   with   one   in   three   Greeks   at   risk   of

36
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,468
living   in   poverty.   It   goes   to   show   the   terrible

37
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:24,449
consequences   of   fiscal   mismanagement.   And   as   Greece   continues   down

38
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,480
its   road   to   recovery,   let   us   not   forget   the

39
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,560
valuable   and   devastating   case   study   it   provided.
