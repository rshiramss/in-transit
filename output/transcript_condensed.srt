1
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,379
surprise,   in   2009   it's   revealed   that   the   government   has

2
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:06,640
been   cooking   the   books   and   its   budget   deficit   is

3
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,500
not   6.7%,   but   double   that.   (clears throat)   Whoops.

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
[...content omitted...]

5
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,099
172%   by   2011   with   creditors   quickly   draining   the   bailout

6
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:14,098
[...content omitted...]

7
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,060
causing   unrest   at   home   with   Greeks   bearing   the   burden

8
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,180
of   falling   wages,   rising   taxes,   and   unemployment   above   25%.

9
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,349
So,   when   a   snap   election   occurs   in   2015,   the

10
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:00,930
people   break   over   40   years   of   two-party   rule   and

11
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,139
elect   a   new   anti-austerity   party   to   office   in   a

12
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,340
bid   for   change.   The   new   prime   minister   promises   to

13
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,289
boost   spending   and   throw   down   the   gauntlet   to   the

14
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,199
Troika   to   renegotiate   terms,   raising   tensions   between   the   government

15
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,060
and   the   Troika   until   the   country's   lifeline   snaps   and,

16
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,879
ladies   and   gentlemen,   all   hell   breaks   loose.

17
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,519
Creditors   flee   Greece   once   again   and   a   liquidity   crisis

18
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,920
emerges   with   fear   gripping   the   country   amid   concerns   of

19
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,120
Grexit,   Greece's   departure   from   the   EU.   Negotiations   with   the

20
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,449
Troika   fall   through   as   even   its   members   clash.

21
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,660
And   on   June   30th,   2015,   with   the   government   unable

22
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,980
to   secure   any   further   debt   relief,   Greece   defaults,   missing

23
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,579
a   1.6   billion   Euro   debt   payment   to   the   IMF;

24
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:37,120
the   first   developed   country   to   ever   do   so.

25
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,660
The   foundation   of   Greece's   economy   begins   to   crack   as

26
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,000
the   government   shuts   down   its   stock   exchange   and   banking

27
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,240
system.   Greeks   continue   to   fight   against   a   new   bailout

28
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,329
proposed   by   the   EU,   but   at   this   point,   with

29
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:49,100
the   country   in   financial   purgatory,   Grexit   inching   closer,   and

30
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,000
no   more   leverage   for   negotiation,   on   July   16th   a

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,839
very   desperate   government   throws   in   the   towel,   grabbing   ahold

32
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,519
of   the   EU's   third   lifeline   and   accepting   an   86

33
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,379
billion   Euro   bailout   in   August.   And   so,   with   the

34
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,720
fight   to   boost   spending   meeting   a   dramatic   end,   the
